# What's Cooking?

Here we need to predict the type of cuisine based on the ingredients in the dish.

The dataset has: the recipe id, the type of cuisine, and the list of ingredients of each recipe (of variable length). The data is stored in JSON format. 

An example of a recipe node in train.json:

 ```{
 "id": 24717,
 "cuisine": "indian",
 "ingredients": [
     "tumeric",
     "vegetable stock",
     "tomatoes",
     "garam masala",
     "naan",
     "red lentils",
     "red chili peppers",
     "onions",
     "spinach",
     "sweet potatoes"
 ]
 },
 ```
 
 This would be a good practice excercise for NLP skills.
